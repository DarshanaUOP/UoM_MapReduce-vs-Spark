# MapReduce vs Spark Query Calculation Comparison

This repository conducts a comparative analysis between MapReduce and Apache Spark, focusing on the execution of a predefined set of queries. The primary objective is to assess the calculation time for each query in both frameworks and draw meaningful comparisons. By scrutinizing these benchmarks, this project aims to provide insights into the performance characteristics of MapReduce and Spark, aiding users in choosing the most suitable framework for their specific data processing requirements.
